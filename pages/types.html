        <h1>Types</h1>
            
            <p>There are three recognized types of biological overfishing: growth overfishing, recruit overfishing, and ecosystem overfishing.</p>
            
            <br>

            <h2>Growth Overfishing</h2>
            <p>Growth overfishing occurs when fish are harvested at an average size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less than it would be if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.</p>

            <h2>Recruitment Overfishing</h2>
            <p>Recruitment overfishing happens when the mature adult population (spawning biomass) is depleted to a level where it no longer has the reproductive capacity to replenish itselfâ€”there are not enough adults to produce offspring.[32] Increasing the spawning stock biomass to a target level is the approach taken by managers to restore an overfished population to sustainable levels. This is generally accomplished by placing moratoriums, quotas, and minimum size limits on a fish population.</p>
            
            <h2>Ecosystem Overfishing</h2>
            <p>Ecosystem overfishing occurs when the balance of the ecosystem is altered by overfishing. With declines in the abundance of large predatory species, the abundance of small forage type increases causing a shift in the balance of the ecosystem towards smaller fish species.</p>
